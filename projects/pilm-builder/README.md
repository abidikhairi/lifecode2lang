# PILM Builder

Fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy Protein Instruction Language Models (PILMs) from scratch.
This repo provides end-to-end workflows: dataset preparation → pretraining → supervised instruction-tuning → evaluation → deployment.

Tutorials are provided as Jupyter notebooks, while core logic lives in the pilm/ package.


### TODO:
- [] Create streamlit application
- [] Add python modules to ensure reusable, and deployment-friendly code.
